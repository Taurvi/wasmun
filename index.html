                The Director General is tasked with ensuring the academic integrity of WASMUN is keeping in line with previous conferences. This means working with the Secretary General to establish the committees for WASMUN, determining the topics, acquiring the staff for the conference (Directors, Assistant Directors, and Chairs), and properly training the staff. The Director General will also be training an Assistant Director General to potentially take their position in the following conference. The Director General will also be in charge of ensuring the Background guides sufficiently prepare the delegates for their committee, and if possible, review position papers. Finally, the Director will be making rounds in the committees during the conference, and with the Secretary General, resolve any conflicts that arise.

                The main function of PR is to reach out to as many schools in the greater Seattle area (and beyond if possible) to either attend our upcoming conference, or to assist in attending future conferences. As PR will also be having constant communications with the schools, PR will also be tasked with issuing countries to each school, keeping in mind their preferences and what is available. PR will be assisting in putting up the bulk of the content on the WASMUN website, as well as periodically updating the Facebook and other social media outlets that WASMUN possesses. PR will also have to create committee matrices, with all the relevant details pertaining (countries, from which schools, etc.) that will be shared with the Director General and Secretary General. Smaller (but still important) tasks include: helping build up prospective high school teams, maintaining a comprehensive contact list, SECURE A KEYNOTE SPEAKER, network with other organizations, and the creating and distribution of WASMUN merchandise (SWAG). You need to know how to use excel for this.

                Finances main directive is to “manage the books.” This includes projecting the expected income, determining the estimated costs of the conference, and auditing the school payments. Finances will have to constantly keep track of the expenses of the conference, and track the payments made with WASMUN funds, serving something as a secondary check on the Secretariat, to ensure we are utilizing those funds in a reasonable manner. Finances will also be tasked with managing the fiscal reports, which include filing our taxes to the state of Washington, and creating a detailed financial report to pass down to the next Secretariat for WASMUN.

Logistics will also be in charge of making some of the purchases, such as the merchandise, renting the rooms, acquisition of placards/badges, and purchasing any other items needed for the conference. Since Logistics will also be handling WASMUN funds and merchandise, Logistics will have to collaborate with both Finances and PR frequently.
